            <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
            <li>
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                specimen book.
            </li>
            <li>
                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
            </li>
            <li>
                It was popularised in the 1960s
                with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
                recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
                versions of Lorem Ipsum.
            </li>
            <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
            <li>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.</li>
            <li>It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
                over 2000 years old.
            </li>
            <li>Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
                discovered the undoubtable source.
            </li>
            <li>Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum
                et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
